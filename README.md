# I-Game-Robot
"I, Game & Robot" is a global Web3 blockchain mobile game design challenge initiated by DeAutoDAO. We invite game planners, artists, designers, Web3 developers, engineers and other innovators to participate in designing a Web3-based robo-vehicle customization game in 6 weeks.

Born out of democratic innovation of technology, DeAuto is the world's first crypto robo-vehicle community. Click here ðŸ‘‰ https://www.deauto.io to get more info about DeAuto.

This game is a playground and an incubator. Players are also creators. They can customize their robo-vehicles through easy-to-use modular settings. They can create value to gain tokens and incentives that work in the real world. Most importantly, the results created by them in this game can be manufactured and sold in the real world. 

"I, Game & Robot" hackathon is divided into four challenges: Game Design Planning, Concept Art Design, Game Feature Design, and Monetization Model Design. Starting from the Game Design Planning, you can choose to cooperate with other participants in one challenge or cooperate with participants in other challenges.
